Agenda Day 1
============
1. MS Azure Basics--Subscription, Resource Groups, Resources
2. Azure DNS Zones
   --- Public DNS Zones
   --- Private DNS Zones

===================================================================

Free azure subs:

$200 credit for a month

Convert to pay az you go after a month free trial

To create free account:
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free

Pay As go account:


On premise

1. Capital Expenditure
2. Operational Expenditure


In cloud

1. Operational Expenditure



Azure has multiple regions

Each region has multiple data centers (Availability zones)

You can choose one of regions: and then deploy your resources in that region in multiple data centers 
so that you can get the high availability of your apps that you are running in azure.

**********Subscriptions**********
================================
Every azure subscription will be assigned a unique subscription id. Subscription id will be useful to make any API calls to azure cloud platform.


Why multiple azure subscriptions?
1. For different set of environments ex. dev/ qa/ prod, etc.
2. To segregate access to set of vendors to a particular subscription
for segregating resources ex. I want to use 1 azure account for internal resources, 1 azure account 
for my partner1, 1 account for partner2, and so on


Why multiple subscriptions?
I want to manage my resources efficiently for every different environment.

*********Deployment models*********


1. ARM Model: resource manager model: latest model of deployment of resources on azure

	    - based on JSON (Java script object notation)
				     
 	    - Automation is much easy
				      
	    - You can deploy multiple resources at a time
				      
	    - You can deploy a complete solution in one go (App: 3 tier app: front end tier, middile tier, backend tier -----> ARM temmplate)



2. Classic model: ASM (Azure service manager/classic model): older method of deployment of resources on azure
		- XML Schema
							    
		- Automation is bit difficult
							    
		- You had to deploy one resource at a time


===============================
Resource group: Logical container to hold all resources together in azure. You can create resource groups based on departments/ projects so that you can logically group respective resources correspoinding to that project. Plus, you can grant role based access control at Resorce group level.


One resource will always be part of one resource group only.



3 users working for project1
prject1-rg: 2 users admin : owner access
            1 user reader: reader access

To create any resource, you need to create resource group.



==============

Resource group: logical container where you can store any resources and segragate based on the projects

project1----> RG1
	- Manager1
	-Team member1, Team member2

Project2---->RG2
	-Manager2
        - TM3, TM4

You can control access to the resources easily this way.Access control will be much easier with resource groups


RG: Location (ex. east us)
can contain resources from various other locations.



EX1
RG1---> East us
          -TM1 West US-----------------> STG Account1 --> West US

	  -TM2 Europe location----------> STG ACt2--> Europe location 

Resources can be from any location
ex of different resources can be a VM, Storage accnt, Virtual network, subnet, public IP, NIC card

ARM also gives you ability to group your resources by using a concept called as Resource groups.

RG-Project1 ----> East US------------------> grant project1 users access at RG level
       VM1 ----> East US
       VM2-----> Southeast asia
       VM3-----> West europe


============
***********Methods of deploying resources*********
====================================================
1. By using portal
2. Using cloudshell (1. Bash 2. PowerShell)
3. PowerShell installed on your machine (You have to install Az module of POWERSHELL)
4. ARM templates: You create ARM templates that are based on JSON language that helps you to create resources in one go by using a template.This is one of the most efficient method to create resources.
5. Terraform/Ansible/Chef/Puppet: DevOps tools (Configuration management Tool)
6. SDKs provided by Azure for different langugages.
==========================================================================
DNS: Domain name service/system

Helps you to resolve names to the IP Addresses

Public IP: used over internet

Private IP Addresses: used in your local environment/Company network.


Public DNS: Resolve domain names over internet

facebook.com

Private DNS: Resolves domain names in local environment/intranet/company network.


Azure DNS: Helps to to resolves domain names to IP addresses


SOA: Start of Authority record: Primary DNS Server that is responsible for domain name resolution
NS: Name server record: Primary + secondary DNS Server.

A: Host record: resolves name to IP address



Private DNS Zones

VNET1

VM1: 192.168.0.4

VM2: 10.104.0.4

private DNS Zone----adatum.local

VM1.adatum.local

VM2.adatum.local


10.0.0.4

mylinuxvm1.adatum.local
