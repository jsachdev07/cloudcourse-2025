# Instance Store vs EBS in AWS

## 1. **Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage)**

Instance Store is temporary storage that is physically attached to the host machine running the EC2 instance. It is **ephemeral** in nature, meaning that the data stored on an Instance Store is lost if the instance is stopped, terminated, or fails.

- **How it works**: When you launch an EC2 instance, Instance Store volumes are automatically created and connected to the instance. This storage is tied directly to the life of the instance, meaning if the instance is terminated, all data on the Instance Store is lost.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Ephemeral storage**: Data is **lost** when the instance is stopped or terminated.
  - **Temporary**: Useful for short-term storage needs, such as cache data, buffers, or temporary files.
  - **Local storage**: It is physically attached to the host machine and usually provides very high input/output operations per second (IOPS).
  - **Cost**: Instance Store volumes come at no additional cost beyond the cost of the EC2 instance itself.
  - **Data persistence**: Data does not persist across instance stops/starts or reboots.
  - **No snapshot capability**: You cannot take snapshots of Instance Store volumes like you can with EBS volumes.

- **Use Case**:
  - Ideal for **temporary storage** where persistence isn’t important (e.g., storing temporary files, buffers, caches).
  - **High-performance computing** or **data processing** tasks that need fast storage but don’t require data to be retained after the instance is terminated.
  
- **Example**: Running a web server where the file system is cached and the data does not need to persist beyond the life of the instance.

## 2. **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

EBS provides persistent block-level storage that can be attached to EC2 instances. It is designed to store data that needs to persist even after the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.

- **How it works**: When you launch an EC2 instance, you can attach EBS volumes to it. EBS volumes are separate from the instance, and their data persists even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated. You can also detach EBS volumes from one instance and attach them to another instance if needed.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Persistent storage**: Data remains intact even after stopping or terminating the EC2 instance.
  - **Block-level storage**: Similar to a hard drive attached to a server, EBS provides a block storage device that can be formatted with a file system (e.g., NTFS, ext4).
  - **Snapshot support**: You can create snapshots of EBS volumes, which are backups stored in Amazon S3. These snapshots can be used to restore the data or create new EBS volumes.
  - **Cost**: You pay for the storage that you allocate. It is priced based on the volume size, the type of EBS (e.g., SSD, HDD), and the provisioned IOPS.
  - **Performance**: Offers different performance options based on your requirements, such as standard magnetic (cheapest), General Purpose SSD (gp2), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1), etc.
  - **Scalability**: EBS volumes can be dynamically resized and expanded. You can also increase the IOPS if needed.
  - **Multiple volume types**: EBS offers multiple types of volumes for different use cases, such as:
    - **General Purpose SSD (gp2)**: Balanced price/performance for most workloads.
    - **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)**: High performance for I/O intensive applications.
    - **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**: Low-cost storage for large throughput workloads.
    - **Cold HDD (sc1)**: Lowest-cost storage for infrequently accessed data.

- **Use Case**:
  - Ideal for **persistent storage** such as database storage, file systems, application data, and system boot drives.
  - **Critical data** that needs to be backed up and can be restored (via snapshots).
  - **Long-term storage** for workloads that need reliable, consistent storage.

- **Example**: Running a database that requires persistent storage. EBS volumes are ideal for storing the data and logs of a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## **Comparison of Instance Store and EBS**

| **Feature**            | **Instance Store**                     | **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Persistence**         | Ephemeral (data lost on stop/terminate) | Persistent (data remains after stop/terminate) |
| **Data Backup**         | No snapshot support                    | Supports snapshots (backup to S3)          |
| **Cost**                | Included in the EC2 cost               | Separate cost based on volume size, type, and IOPS |
| **Performance**         | High IOPS (depends on instance type)   | Varies (General Purpose SSD, IOPS SSD, etc.) |
| **Resizing**            | Cannot resize after creation           | Can resize and change volume types         |
| **Use Case**            | Temporary storage (cache, buffer, temp files) | Persistent storage for databases, file systems, and applications |
| **Backup/Recovery**     | No built-in backup/recovery            | Supports snapshot-based backups           |
| **Availability**        | Limited to the lifecycle of the instance | Can be detached and reattached to other instances |
| **Typical Applications**| Caching, temporary data storage       | Databases, file systems, persistent data  |

## **Summary**

- **Instance Store** is **ephemeral**, meaning data is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated. It is ideal for **temporary data** like caches or temporary files, and provides **high performance** for workloads that don't need data persistence.
  
- **EBS** is **persistent**, meaning the data stays intact even if the instance is stopped or terminated. It is perfect for **critical data** and **long-term storage** needs, offering features like **snapshots** and **resizing** options.

When choosing between them, consider:
- **Use Instance Store** if you need temporary, high-performance storage and can afford to lose data when the instance is stopped.
- **Use EBS** if you need reliable, persistent storage that must survive instance stops or terminations and can be backed up and restored.
