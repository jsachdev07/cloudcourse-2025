# Understanding UserData in AWS EC2 Instances

In AWS EC2, **UserData** is a feature that allows you to automate the setup of an EC2 instance when it is launched. It's typically used for running initialization scripts, such as installing software, configuring settings, or applying patches, at the time of instance launch.

## What is UserData?
UserData is a script or configuration that is passed to an EC2 instance during its launch. This script can be written in bash, PowerShell (for Windows), or other shell scripting languages depending on the operating system of the EC2 instance. When the instance starts, the UserData script runs automatically.

You can use UserData to:
- Install software packages.
- Set up server configurations.
- Initialize the environment (e.g., add users, configure networking, etc.).
- Download scripts from an external server and execute them.

## Key Points:
- **UserData scripts** are executed **only once** during the first boot of the EC2 instance.
- The script can be **Bash** (for Linux-based instances) or **PowerShell** (for Windows-based instances).
- The script can be added directly when creating an EC2 instance or later by modifying the instance configuration.

## Example of Using UserData

### 1. Linux EC2 Instance Example:
Let's say you're launching a Linux EC2 instance (like an Ubuntu instance) and you want to run a script that installs Apache HTTP server and starts it.

#### Example UserData script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update the package repository
apt-get update -y

# Install Apache web server
apt-get install apache2 -y

# Start Apache service
systemctl start apache2

# Enable Apache to start on boot
systemctl enable apache2
This script does the following:

Updates the package repository.

Installs the Apache web server.

Starts the Apache service.

Ensures Apache starts automatically on system reboot.

To use this script, you would enter it into the UserData section while creating your EC2 instance.
```
